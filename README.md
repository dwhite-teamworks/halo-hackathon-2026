# halo-hackathon-2026
 This repository hosts the official dataset provided by Teamworks and Sportlogiq for the HALO (Hockey Analytics League Operations) Hackathon.  The dataset is intended for use by registered hackathon participants to explore hockey performance, tactics, and decision-making through data-driven analysis.

**Datasets**

The datasets made available for this competition have been curated specifically for the event. They represent a subset of professional hockey data adapted for research and public use, focusing on recent NHL games to ensure relevance and practical application. 

**Sportlogiq Event Data**

Event data from Sportlogiq’s industry leading analytics dataset. 
Half season sample from 2024-25 season 

**Teamworks Player Tracking Data*****
Half season sample from 2024-25 season aligning with range of Sportlogiq event data 


**Submission Requirements**

Submissions should focus on translating hockey data into clear, actionable intelligence for hockey decision-makers.

Each submission should include:

A clear statement of impact, describing what hockey problem or decision the analysis aims to inform and why it matters.

Key insights and conclusions, presented upfront and supported by evidence from the data.

Actionable implications, outlining how the findings could influence coaching strategy, player usage, development, or front-office decision-making.

Analytical approach, summarizing how Sportlogiq tracking and event data were used to generate the insights, including key assumptions and limitations.

Clear structure and storytelling, ensuring the work is easy to follow and communicates effectively to a hockey operations audience.

Supporting code, models, or technical details may be included as an appendix and should reinforce the insights rather than serve as the primary focus of the submission.


**Research Themes**

Participants may explore any topic they choose. These three optional themes can be used as thought-starters

**1. Sequence Intelligence**

Analyze how multi-event sequences develop and affect game outcomes.

Examples:

Chains of actions that lead to scoring chances or turnovers
Identifying key “play initiators”
Detecting critical points in sequences or defensive plays that shift momentum

**2. Pressure & Space Dynamics**

Quantify how players create or respond to pressure on the ice.

Examples:

Puck-carrier decision-making under pressure
Defensive spacing and successful containment
Timing and positioning during high-speed transitions

**3. Player Interaction & Shift Chemistry**

Understand how players influence one another and impact team performance.

Examples:

Complementary player movement patterns
Identifying line or pair synergies
Detecting off-puck contributions that enable scoring opportunities
